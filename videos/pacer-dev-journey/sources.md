# Sources: the developer's afternoon with the pacer

**Source of record.** `sample_application/` (original code written for ShipShow; `SOURCE.md` says it is not Aperiam's) at
repo commit `dbb7e0070f66dabd670b98ff9bb4d415ed2a3c69` (`origin/main` after #17). One pin: the code is original, so there
is no upstream. Runs are in throwaway copies of that commit made with `git archive` (`git archive <pin> sample_application | tar -x`), recorded with `capture.mjs`
(`videos/pacer-dev-journey/results/captures/*.txt`, each with a `.sha256`, pin in the header). The `alone-*` captures run `results/experiments/alone.mjs`, copied into the scratch copy (it takes a campaign id, a currency, a budget and `flushEvery`). `ANSWER.md` was read last and used only to check the
conclusions below against the code and the runs; the video does not quote it.

## Terms
- **Spend, spent:** USD cents the exchange billed (`src/ledger.mjs:1`).
- **Budget:** the campaign's daily budget in the minor units of its own currency (`src/campaign.mjs:1-2`).
- **Batch:** the ledger's 500 records per database write, shared by every campaign (`src/ledger.mjs:4`).
- **Buffer:** where records wait until a batch is saved; `spent` does not see them (`src/ledger.mjs:8,20,24`). A save is `flush()` (`src/ledger.mjs:11-16`).
- **Contract test:** `test/budget-contract.test.mjs`, which runs the three campaigns together.

## Claims
Tags: `[read]` read at the pin, `[ran]` run in a copy of the pin.

- **C1** `[ran]` The morning after (who noticed is not in the sources, and the video does not say): US 111%, EU 93%, Tokyo 181% of a budget worth $100 each. `results/captures/scenario-before.txt:8-10`.
- **C2** `[read]` The three hand-off notes say: pacing "is exact: a campaign never serves past its budget" (`sample_application/agents/pacing.md:11`); "No change to what pacing or the dashboard sees" (`agents/throughput.md:11`); "pacing needs no change: it already compares spend with the daily budget" (`agents/currency.md:12`). Every test passed when they were written: "All 3 tests pass", "All 5 tests pass", "All 8 tests pass".
- **C3** `[read]` Pacing compares `ledger.spent(campaign.id)` with `campaign.dailyBudget`. `src/pacing.mjs:3`.
- **C4** `[read]` `ledger.spent` is in USD cents (`src/ledger.mjs:1`); `dailyBudget` is in the campaign's own minor units, whole yen for JPY (`src/campaign.mjs:1-2`).
- **C5** `[read]` 15,000 yen is $100: JPY is 150 per dollar with 0 decimal digits (`src/fx.mjs:6`), so `minorToUsdCents(15000, "JPY")` is 10,000 cents. Pacing reads 15,000 as 15,000 cents, $150.
- **C15** `[ran]` The euro campaign alone with a write on every record stops at 92%: 8,469 of 9,200 EUR. `results/captures/alone-eu-EUR-9200-1.txt:7`. Reason `[read]`: pacing reads the euro budget of 9,200 as 9,200 US cents, $92 (C4), while the budget is worth $100 (`src/fx.mjs:5`).
- **C6** `[ran]` Tokyo alone with a write on every record (batching off) stops at 150%: 22,502 of 15,000 yen. `results/captures/alone-jp-JPY-15000-1.txt:7`.
- **C7** `[read]` The ledger writes once per 500 records, shared by every campaign (`src/ledger.mjs:4,21`), and `spent` returns only what has been flushed (`src/ledger.mjs:24`).
- **C8** `[ran]` The US campaign alone, with batching, reaches 105% (10,500 of 10,000 cents); with a write on every record, 100%. `results/captures/alone-us-USD-10000-500.txt:7`, `results/captures/alone-us-USD-10000-1.txt:7`.
- **C9** `[ran]` Tokyo alone with batching reaches 175% (26,250 yen). `results/captures/alone-jp-JPY-15000-500.txt:7`. In the scenario, sharing the batch with the other two, it reaches 181% (C1).
- **C10** `[read]` The throughput agent rebuilt the older tests with `flushEvery: 1`: `test/engine.test.mjs:8`, `test/pacing.test.mjs:8,17` (its note, `agents/throughput.md:8`, says so; `history/0003-Batch-ledger-writes.patch` touches only those two). `test/report.test.mjs:8` was written new by the currency agent, already with `flushEvery: 1` (`history/0004-Support-EUR-and-JPY-campaigns.patch:94-107`). No test runs pacing at the production batch size, except the contract test.
- **C16** `[read]` The contract test and the overspend scenario were added by the reviewer, not by one of the three agents: the patch is from `reviewer` (`sample_application/history/0005-Add-the-overspend-scenario-and-a-budget-contract-tes.patch:2`). None of the three agents' own tests runs the campaigns together (C10 and `agents/*.md`).
- **C11** `[ran]` The contract test runs the three campaigns together; USD passes, EUR and JPY fail and are marked `todo`, so the suite stays green. `results/captures/tests-before.txt:9,15,37`. EUR spent 9,331 of 10,000 cents (under); JPY 18,081 (over): `results/captures/tests-before.txt:21,43`.
- **C12** `[ran]` With the fix (below) the same scenario ends at 100% for all three: US 10,003 USD, EU 9,203 EUR, Tokyo 15,005 JPY. `results/captures/scenario-after.txt:8-10`. The few cents over: `[inferred]` they are one impression, since the check happens before the cost is added (`src/engine.mjs:7-8`).
- **C13** `[ran]` The fix is two changes: pacing compares against `minorToUsdCents(campaign.dailyBudget, campaign.currency)`, and `spent` adds the records still in the buffer. `results/captures/fix-diff.txt:22-25,38-39`. With the `todo` marks removed the contract test passes, 3 of 3: `results/captures/tests-after.txt:9,15,21,29,33` (the fixed scratch copy, with the `{ todo: c.currency === "USD" ? false : "fails today" }` option deleted from line 27 of `test/budget-contract.test.mjs`; without that edit the same command gives 1 pass and 2 todo).
- **C14** `[inferred]` Each agent tested its own task and it passed (C2); the failures live in the interaction between the changes, and nobody owned the whole. Basis: C2 to C11. The video does not say the notes were true: two were not (C7, C4).

## The fix is a proposal, not a commit
The fix was applied only in a scratch copy (`/tmp/pacer-scratch/fixed`), not to `sample_application/`, which stays as the demo. In that copy
the history-replay test (`test/history.test.mjs`) fails, as it should, because the tree no longer equals the replayed history.

## Left out, and why
- `src/report.mjs` and the dashboard's conversion: correct, and not part of either cause.
- That one impression can overshoot because the check runs before the bill: mentioned once in scene 06 as the cents over, not explained.
- The five commits as patches (`history/`) and how the reviewer merged them: the video starts at the dashboard.
- Alternatives to the fix (flush on every record, or a per-campaign buffer): a decision video's job; this one shows the fix that passes the contract test.
