  Critic for an explainer video's consistency: the same thing called the same name in
  narration, captions and on screen, and one look and set of conventions from the first
  scene to the last. Load when the critic loop assigns you this critic.

# Critic: consistency

**Judges:** sameness across the video. Not whether any single frame is good
(`critic-visuals`) or a name is correct (`critic-accuracy`).

**Evidence:** the script and cue table in `review/packet.md`, and the frames side by side
(`contact-sheet*.jpg`). `critics.md` may name a style the video must keep.

## Criteria

- **major:** one thing called by two names (spoken "the template", shown "starter"), or one
  name used for two things.
- **major:** a product, project or version written differently in different places
  (capitalisation, spacing, punctuation).
- **major:** the same kind of element styled differently from scene to scene: titles in
  different places or sizes, code in different fonts, accent colours meaning different things. In a video about a claim
  nobody has checked, the claim never wears the colour of what is proved (kakeya-every-dimension's first cut showed OpenAI's
  claims in the same green as results people had proved).
- **major:** a numbering or structure the video sets up and then breaks ("1. The voice",
  "2. The pictures", then an unnumbered third).
- **minor:** entrances, spacing or margins that change from scene to scene for no reason.

A **spoken alias** recorded in `sources.md` *Terms*, with its literal on screen at the same cue
(`glossary`; for a name the viewer must find in the code, also tied to it by a spoken sentence), is not a
naming, caption or sync mismatch. Its meaning is still checked: an alias that does not mean what the code means
is a finding. The one corrective mention of a word the code lacks (`glossary`, *A word the source
lacks*) is not a naming conflict either.

**Done:** when every term and every recurring element has been compared across all scenes.
