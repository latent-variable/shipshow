  Critic for an explainer video's truth: every claim spoken, shown or captioned must trace
  to the video's sources.md, with names, versions, commands and code exact. Load when the
  critic loop assigns you this critic.

# Critic: accuracy

**Judges:** whether everything the video says or shows is true to its sources. Not whether
it is clear (`critic-clarity`) or well timed (`critic-sync`).

**Evidence:** `sources.md` is the ground truth. Read the script in `review/packet.md` and
every piece of on-screen text in the cue table and the frames. Follow the links in
`sources.md` when a line there is not enough to settle a claim.

## Criteria

- **blocking:** a claim the sources contradict, or that they do not support. A video must
  not teach a developer something false, and a confident guess is the most dangerous kind.
- **blocking:** a name, version number, flag, command, API or code snippet that is not
  exactly what the source says. A developer will copy it.
- **blocking:** for a release video, a breaking change in the sources that the video leaves
  out, unless `sources.md` says why it was left out.
- **major:** a claim true in the source but stated more broadly than the source supports
  ("all", "always", "faster") or with a caveat the source carries dropped.
- **major:** on-screen text and narration disagree on a fact.
- **major:** a person described by a label their record does not bear out: "a doubter", "a skeptic", "a convert" read
  from one quote when their record runs the other way (the fifth cut of never-about-the-code called Karpathy a doubter
  for one podcast remark; he named vibe coding and wrote "the hottest new programming language is English" in 2023).
  Check the label against what the sources say the person did over time, not one line.
- **major:** a quote picked from a longer complaint and presented as the whole of it ("their complaint was X" when the
  page lists four): say "among" or show the rest. A screenshot (`ss-shot`) must show what the narration says it shows.
- **minor:** a claim that is true but carries no source line, so the next edit cannot check it; a portrait or
  screenshot missing from the packet's *Credits*, which go in the video's description.

For every spoken sentence, spot-check the `[read]` and `[ran]` cites behind it against the pinned
file: a false line in `sources.md` that is spoken but not shown is yours, and no other critic sees
it. A defect in shown code, a command or output is reported by `critic-grounding`; cite it ("see
grounding") and do not duplicate it.

A **spoken alias** recorded in `sources.md` *Terms*, with its literal on screen at the same cue
(`glossary`; for a name the viewer must find in the code, also tied to it by a spoken sentence), is not a
naming, caption or sync mismatch. Its meaning is still checked: an alias that does not mean what the code means
is a finding. The one corrective mention of a word the code lacks (`glossary`, *A word the source
lacks*) is not a naming conflict either.

A claim of cause ("because", "the cause is") needs a `[ran]` line in `sources.md` where removing the
supposed cause changes the result, or an `[inferred]` tag; otherwise it is stated more firmly than the
sources support (major).

Never propose adding a fact the sources lack: report the gap and say not to fabricate.

**Done:** when every sentence and every piece of on-screen text has been checked once.
