Your agents work faster than you can follow. ShipShow turns what they did, and each call they need from you, into a short narrated video, so you decide knowing what you are deciding. It runs on your own machine.

The output format I am most bullish on is fully custom / bespoke explainer videos generated on any arbitrary topic. Experiment with things like &quot;Create a 3b1b style video explainer on X. Use my ElevenLabs API key for audio narration&quot;. (you'd need an API key for the latter or you can ask your LLM to find you decent free alternatives that use your local compute). This is actually starting to work! In summary: As LLMs get better, they will do more and more of the legwork autonomously, and a lot more of our work will rise up the abstractions into oversight and understanding."></a>

## How it works

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/how-it-works.svg" width="100%" alt="Five steps. Ask: a question, or a call your agent needs. Script and scenes: a fresh agent writes them from the code. Voice: Kokoro or OmniVoice, on your machine. Render: HyperFrames shows each thing on its word. Critics: fresh agents judge it until it passes; a failing round loops back to the script and scenes to be fixed and judged again. Then an MP4 you watch before you decide.">
  <br>
  <sub>Ask &rarr; Script + scenes &rarr; Voice &rarr; Render &rarr; Critics &rarr; MP4</sub>
</p>

[Kokoro-82M](https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M) or [OmniVoice](https://github.com/k2-fsa/OmniVoice) does the voice and [HyperFrames](https://hyperframes.heygen.com) draws and records the scenes. Your agent writes the script and the scenes, and a panel of critic agents decides when the video is done.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/critics.svg" width="100%" alt="The critics: fresh agents, one question each; the agent that made the video never judges it. Nine numbered cards: accuracy, is every claim true? Clarity, will they follow it? Pacing, can they keep up? Sync, is it shown when it is said? Visuals, is every frame readable? Consistency, one name for one thing? Engagement, would they keep watching? Decision, can they make the call? Grounding, is the evidence real?">

## Install as a Claude Code plugin

```
claude plugin install shipshow --marketplace latent-variable/shipshow
```

Needs Claude Code 2.1.275 or later, and works once this is on `main`. Three skills work in any repository: `code-context`, `change-context` and `evidence-standard`. The rest (briefs, plans, scripts, hand-backs, `explainer-video`, `critic-loop` and the critics) feed or judge the video pipeline, which needs this repo cloned and set up as below.

## Set it up

Node.js 22+, Python 3.10 to 3.13 (not newer: the pinned Kokoro does not support it) and ffmpeg (tested on macOS):

```
npm install
npm run setup
npm run doctor
npm run make -- videos/how-it-works
```

The first run downloads the voice model (about 340 MB) and, if needed, a headless Chrome (about 190 MB). Then ask your agent for one:

> Make me a ShipShow video on the retry logic you just wrote. I need to decide whether to ship it today.

## Make it yours

Tell your agent how you like your videos ("faster", "open with the decision", "always show the code") and it keeps that in `local/`, which never leaves your machine, along with videos about private code. Videos play at 1.25 times a relaxed pace by default; `npm run make -- <folder> --speed 1.5` tries another.

**A better voice, or your own.** On a Mac with Apple Silicon, `npm run setup:omnivoice` adds [OmniVoice](https://github.com/k2-fsa/OmniVoice): speech we find clearer and more natural, and it can clone a voice from a few seconds of recording. Put a clip at `local/voices/<name>.wav` (yours, or someone who agreed), and `npm run make -- <folder> --engine omnivoice --voice <name>` tries it. For a video where the tone is the point, `npm run setup:drama` adds [Fish Audio Drama 3](https://huggingface.co/fishaudio/drama-3), which you direct from the script: `[deadpan] Like animals.` is said deadpan, and the caption reads "Like animals." (`--engine drama`; it needs about 40 GB of free memory). `npm run setup:listen` adds a second listen: NVIDIA's Parakeet hears the finished narration against the script and lists what to check. Kokoro stays the default and runs anywhere. Review effort is yours too: a `quick` review takes about a minute of critics, `thorough` up to six (`npm run critics -- <folder>` shows the plan).

Every video takes a theme: colours, fonts, layout and motion in one folder. Ship with `shipshow`, `paper`, `launch`, `buildday` (the look of [our pitch](videos/why-shipshow), from the LA AI Hackathon's page, with captions that light each word as it is spoken) `lofi` (a late-night study room: a dusk sky over a city skyline, drifting light, dust and film grain), `signal` (near-black, a highlighter yellow and big grotesque type, for a video that argues a point) or `chalk` (a blackboard at night, chalk dust in the lamplight, an eraser wipe between scenes, for math and theory), or have your agent build one from a client's brand; `--theme paper` previews any theme on any video. A video can also carry a music bed, which drops under the voice while it speaks, and a few sound effects on the cues that move (`data-sfx="whoosh"`), synthesized, sparse and set under the voice.

## How we work

- **Use it on your own work**, then turn whatever got in the way into a pull request.
- **A bar you keep wishing a video met becomes a critic.**
- **Every change is a pull request**, with CI and an automated review before it merges.

Everything about the code, the skills and the commands is in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).
